This project is the thirteen challenge in the Columbia Fintech Bootcamp.

This challenge deals with Neural Networks using Tensorflow and Keras.


The source data includes: 
* [Startup Applicant Data](./Resources/applicants_data.csv)

The objective was to generate a model that estimate the success of an startup based on the applicant data and other parameters, different methods are used with machine learning to improve and increase the performance of the model

## Technologies

The main language is Python, with the following auxiliary modules/libraries.
Python version is 3.7, developed in an independent conda virtual environment

### pandas
This module handles DataFrames (dynamic tables), to maniupulate, store data, do automatic calculations and adding dynamic data.

### pathlib
This module helps abstracting the OS discrepancies between folder structures and files.

### numpy
Library for generic Math calculations (in this case average)

### tensorflow
Machine Learning library that allows the creation, trainig, modeling and testing of Neural Networks in Python

### keras

Tensorflow abstraction library to facilitate the creation of machine learning processes based on Neural Networks

### skleark

Library for machine learning model creation, processing, testing, evaluation and reporting, in this case prepocessing categorical data, spliting between test and training data and PCA
